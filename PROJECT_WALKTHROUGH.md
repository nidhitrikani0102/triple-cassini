        *   Go to "Vendors" tab.
        *   Click "Assign Vendor".
        *   Search for a vendor (e.g., "Photographer").
        *   Send a job request with an offered amount.
4.  **Payments**:
    *   Once a vendor completes a job, click "Pay Now".
    *   This automatically records the payment as an expense in your Budget.

### 🏪 Vendor (Service Provider)

2.  **User Management**:
    *   View all Users and Vendors.
    *   **Block/Unblock**: Restrict access for suspicious accounts.

## 🔄 4. Key Workflows

### Vendor Assignment Lifecycle
1.  **User** sends request -> Status: **Pending**.
2.  **Vendor** accepts -> Status: **In Progress**.
3.  **Vendor** completes work -> Status: **Completed**.
4.  **User** pays -> Status: **Paid** (Expense added to Budget).

### Invitation System
1.  **User** adds Guest (Email or In-App).
2.  **System** sends email with RSVP link.
3.  **Guest** clicks link -> Updates status to **Accepted/Declined**.
4.  **User** sees real-time status updates on Event Page.

## 🔧 5. Troubleshooting

*   **MongoDB Connection Error**: Ensure MongoDB is running locally (`mongod`) or your Atlas URI is correct in `.env`.
*   **Email Not Sending**: Check `EMAIL_USER` and `EMAIL_PASS`. For Gmail, use an "App Password", not your login password. Check server console for fallback logs if email fails.
*   **Images Not Loading**: Ensure the `uploads/` folder exists in `server/` and you are running the server.
